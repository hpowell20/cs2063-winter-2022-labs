# Pair Programming

## Overview

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation.  Pair programming consists of two roles: the driver and the observer (also called the navigator).  The driver is the one writing the code while the observer reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.  Pair programming has many benefits in software development, CS education, and particularly learning mobile application development (Seyam and McCrickard, 2016).

One of you will be the "driver"; the other will be the "navigator". The driver types at the computer, while the navigator reviews what is being written and watches for mistakes. Every 15 minutes, the driver and navigator should switch roles.

In a common model of pair programming the driver and navigator use a single computer. Today we won't be quite so strict. The driver and navigator will use a single instance of AndroidStudio, but can use multiple computers (e.g., you might want AndroidStudio open on one lab machine, and a browser with documentation on another).
